Money was never really a problem for us day-to-day. It became one when we
started saving for bigger things.

A house deposit. Future plans. The general feeling that we should be doing
better, but were not quite sure why.

We tried spreadsheets first. They worked... until they did not. One of us would
update it. The other would not. We would be standing in a shop asking, "did you
add that?" Eventually, we stopped trusting it.

That frustration is why Personifi exists.

## Our approach: conscious spending

We do not follow a strict budget. We do not want to feel like every coffee is a
mistake.

Instead, we focus on conscious spending.

That means:

* Seeing everything we spend, together
* Being intentional about what we care about
* Making sure progress on big goals is visible
* Adjusting without guilt when life changes

Personifi gives us a shared view of our money, without forcing us into a rigid
system.

## How we structure things

We keep things simple.

* Shared categories for day-to-day spending
* Buckets for bigger goals that do not fit into a month
* A monthly view that shows income, spending, and what is left

This lets us enjoy spending on things we care about, while still seeing steady
progress towards longer-term goals.

No mental maths. No awkward conversations. No guessing.

## Why this works for us as a couple

The biggest change was not saving more money. It was removing friction.

We are both looking at the same numbers. We both understand where things stand.
We do not have to explain purchases to each other.

Money stops being a source of tension and starts being something we manage
together.

## If you are in a similar place

If you are a couple saving towards something meaningful and want clarity
without turning money into a constant source of stress, Personifi might help.

You do not need to be perfect. You just need a system that fits how you
actually live.
