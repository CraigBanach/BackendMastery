Absolutely — I took a good look at your homepage so we can start improving it for **clarity, emotional pull, and specific audience positioning** (especially _couples_) rather than default fintech language. Here’s what I see and what you can do next.

---

## 📌 What Your Current Homepage Does Well

Your existing page clearly communicates that Personifi is:

- for **UK couples** managing money together
- solving _money miscommunication_ and _opaque shared finances_
- quick to get started with both partners included free ([personifi.xyz][1])

That’s already stronger than many budgeting apps that speak to “everyone.” You have a niche (couples) — a huge advantage.

---

## 🚀 How It Could Be Better (Copy-wise)

Right now, the language on the homepage is a bit **feature and problem focused** and reads a bit like a typical fintech SaaS pitch rather than a _relationship-centred budgeting solution_. You’re trying to solve _relationship problems_, not _expense tracking problems_ — and customers respond more strongly when that comes through.

Every great homepage does one thing first:

> **Help a visitor instantly understand: “Is this for me?”**
> You do this partly, but it can be _much sharper_.

_Example from strong financial copywriting practice:_
A great headline speaks directly to a clear life situation or emotional payoff. Big winners like YNAB don’t say “budget tool” — they say things like “Give every dollar a job” because that resonates with real user experience and comes from how they talk about their method. ([Semrush][2])

## 🧠 Suggested Headline + Sub-headline (Better Fit for Couples)

Here are **a few versions** you can A/B test:

### **A. Simple & emotional**

**Remove money fights. Build plans together.**
Budgeting for couples who want clarity and harmony.

### **B. Outcome-driven**

**Track money as a couple, not as a spreadsheet war.**
See spending, plan goals, and stop arguing about money.

### **C. Based on real language**

Use the _real words_ people actually say:
**“Finally, a budgeting tool my partner doesn’t hate.”**
Shared budgets, shared goals, simple transparency.

---

## 🧩 What to Highlight Next on the Page

Your current structure is okay, but you could reorder/replace bits like this:

### 1. **Problem → Emotional outcome**

Right now, you do “This is the problem, this is the solution” in a conventional way. Try:

- _Problem first emotional context_
  “Hidden expenses. Surprise overspending. Words like ‘did you add that?’”
  → _Outcome you deliver_ “See exactly where the money went — together.”

This uses **shared experience language** instead of inert product language.

---

## 🎯 Clarifying the Value Proposition

Right now the nav shows things like “How it works”, “Pricing”, etc. You might add:

- **For Couples**
  This clarifies audience immediately — people scanning fast will know it’s for _them_.

- **Real Stories**
  You already have one, but you can bring it up higher or use snippets like:
  “We replaced our 9-year spreadsheet with Personifi.”
  – real quote from user on homepage. ([personifi.xyz][1])

- **What makes couples’ budgeting different**
  Don’t assume people know why this is unique. Say:
  “Track shared goals without losing your independence.”

---

## 📍 About Your TikTok/YouTube Idea

A monthly walkthrough of your own budget—especially _as a couple_—is a great content strategy for two reasons:

### 1) It’s inherently **relatable**

People are curious how _real couples_ manage money — not just abstract tips.

### 2) It naturally reinforces the product

You can demo Personifi _while you talk about your real numbers_ (if you want — you can redact private bits).

This fits well with:

- TikTok’s preference for authenticity
- YouTube’s longer educational storytelling

The key: keep it **consistently real, not polished sales video**.

Example: a short video showing “how we planned savings for X this month and why it worked” — probably takes 20–40 minutes to make at most, real setup. That’s _reasonable effort_ that can bring visibility over time.

---

## 🧠 Quick Next Steps for Homepage Copy

1. **Change your headline to something benefits-driven + couple focus**
   e.g.:

   > _Shared budgets for couples who want clarity, not arguments._

2. **Refocus opening section on emotional payoff**
   e.g.:

   > _Stop explaining transactions. Start planning goals together._

3. **Bring social proof or stories up higher**
   Pick one compelling quote and place it above the fold.

4. **Trim fintech jargon**
   Small changes like “Every transaction syncs instantly” → _“Both partners see everything in real time — no guessing.”_
   This reads more human. ([personifi.xyz][1])

## Want me to rewrite the homepage copy line-by-line?

I can take what’s there now and rewrite each block into a more **human, outcome-focused version** that speaks directly to couples — just let me know if you want:

- A full **block rewrite**
- A clearer **value proposition section**
- Or a simplified **hero + sub-headline + CTA**

Which one do you want first?
