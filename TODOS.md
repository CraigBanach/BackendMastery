- Creating an income category sets a 'budget'. This wording is potentially strange.
- Edit category is shit right now, no data is pre-populated
- Split Categories by type on category page
- Creating a category doesn't apply budget
- Validate duplicate import functionality
- Fix skeleton on import page for infinite scrolling
- Can't refresh budget while keeping month
- Split transaction description should be a placeholder
- Make budgets use date query params
- Only let a user split a transaction between a single (income/expense) category type
- Can't remove the last 0 from import split
