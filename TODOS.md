🎯 Issue Fixed: Salary Import Sign Problem

Root Cause:

The approval process was directly using pendingTransaction.Amount without considering the final storage convention.

Solution Applied:

1. Modified ApprovePendingTransactionAsync to use Math.Abs(pendingTransaction.Amount)
2. Modified BulkApproveTransactionsAsync to use Math.Abs(pendingTransaction.Amount)
3. Added category validation in the individual approval method

How It Works Now:

1. CSV Import: Stores amounts with correct signs based on user's amount convention choice
2. Preview: Shows correctly how transactions will appear
3. Approval: Always stores positive amounts in final transactions
4. UI Display: Handles showing income as positive, expenses as contextually appropriate

Your Test Case:

- CSV: Salary Payment,2500.00 (positive)
- Convention: "Expenses Negative"
- Import: Stored as 2500.00 (positive, correctly identified as income)
- Approval: Stored as 2500.00 (positive via Math.Abs())
- Result: ✅ Income appears as positive amount

The fix ensures consistent positive storage while preserving the import convention logic for proper classification during the
preview phase. Your salary should now import and approve correctly as a positive income transaction! 🚀

> Ok, now I need you to create me a test plan and test CSV(s) to test this comprehensively. Save these in the base directory.
